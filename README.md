Early stage Qt widget for monitoring cameras at NSLS-II
=======================================================

This is a simple Qt-based widget for monitoring a camera on the network, and
performing some overdrawing of the images. It is still subject to change and
also involves at least one developer translating years of C++ Qt experience
into Python and qtpy.

It depends upon qtpy which needs PySide2 or PyQt5 in order to show anything.
